IPCC GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION FACTORS — TRANSPORT FUELS (AR6, 2021)
Compiled for GreenPulse Compliance Reference

SOURCE: IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), Working Group III, Chapter 10: Transport.
Cross-reference: DEFRA/BEIS 2023 Conversion Factors; MoEFCC India 2022 GHG Inventory.

DIESEL (HIGH SPEED DIESEL — HSD)
Emission Factor: 2.68 kg CO₂ per litre of diesel consumed (tank-to-wheel, combustion only).
Full life-cycle (well-to-wheel): 3.17 kg CO₂e per litre (includes extraction and refining).
India Standard: Bureau of Indian Standards IS 1460:2017 (BS VI HSD); sulphur < 10 ppm.
Density: ~0.835 kg/L at 15°C.
Energy content: ~35.8 MJ/litre.
Methane slip: Negligible for compression-ignition engines (< 0.01% of CO₂ equiv.).
Note: GreenPulse uses 2.68 kg/L (combustion, tank-to-wheel) per NLP 2022 and
India GHG Programme guidelines. This is the standard adopted by BEE for PAT scheme reporting.

CNG (COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS)
Emission Factor: 2.04 kg CO₂ per cubic metre (m³) of CNG consumed.
Full life-cycle: 2.55 kg CO₂e per m³.
CNG trucks typical efficiency: 3.5 km/m³ (laden, highway).
India context: ~450,000 CNG trucks operational as of 2024 (MoRTH data),
primarily in NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad under NGT mandates.
CO₂ reduction vs diesel: CNG emits ~25% less CO₂ per kilometre on equivalent trips.
Note: CNG produces ~10-15% lower particulate matter but similar NOx as diesel.

ELECTRIC TRUCKS (Battery Electric Vehicles — BEV)
Direct tailpipe CO₂: 0 kg CO₂ per km (zero-emission vehicle).
Indirect (grid-based): 0.82 kg CO₂ per kWh consumed (India average grid emission factor, CEA 2023).
Typical BEV truck consumption: 1.8–2.2 kWh/km (40-tonne GVW laden).
Effective indirect CO₂: ~1.58 kg CO₂ per km (vs ~0.94 kg/km for BS-VI diesel on same route).
Grid decarbonisation trajectory: India's emission factor is projected at 0.55 kg CO₂/kWh by 2030
as renewables reach 500 GW (as per NDC targets), making BEV trucks significantly cleaner.
FAME II incentive: ₹50 lakh subsidy per electric truck (>12 tonne GVW) under FAME II Phase 3 (2024).

HYDROGEN FUEL CELL (FCEV) — EMERGING
Emission Factor (green hydrogen): 0.0 kg CO₂ per km direct.
Grey hydrogen: 9.3 kg CO₂ per kg H₂ produced (SMR process).
India context: Pilot deployments by HPCL and IOCL (2023–24); commercial scale expected 2027+.

PETROL / GASOLINE (Light Commercial Vehicles)
Emission Factor: 2.31 kg CO₂ per litre.
Life-cycle: 2.78 kg CO₂e per litre.

COMPARISON TABLE — HEAVY FREIGHT, PER 100 KM (LADEN)
Fuel Type       | Consumption    | CO₂ (kg/100km) | Life-cycle CO₂e
----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------
Diesel (BS VI)  | 26 L/100km     | 69.7            | 82.4
CNG             | 22 m³/100km    | 44.9            | 56.1
BEV (2024 grid) | 180 kWh/100km  | 147.6 indirect  | 147.6
BEV (2030 grid) | 180 kWh/100km  | 99.0 indirect   | 99.0
FCEV (green H₂) | 8 kg H₂/100km  | 0.0             | ~2.4

GHG CHARACTERISATION
CO₂ (carbon dioxide): Primary fossil-fuel combustion product. GWP100 = 1.
CH₄ (methane): Minor slip from CNG engines. GWP100 = 27.9 (AR6).
N₂O (nitrous oxide): From diesel combustion. GWP100 = 273. Factor: 0.006 g/km typical HCV.

Note: GreenPulse reports CO₂ only (not CO₂e) for operational simplicity.
For full CO₂e, multiply CH₄ contribution × 27.9 and add to CO₂ total.

REGULATORY THRESHOLDS (INDIA)
BEE PAT Scheme Threshold: 2,000 TOE/year triggers mandatory energy audit.
1 tonne diesel ≈ 1.013 TOE. Fleet burning >1,975 tonnes diesel/year falls under PAT.
Carbon Credit price (India Carbon Market, 2024): ₹430–680 per tonne CO₂ equivalent.
