INDIA NATIONAL LOGISTICS POLICY 2022 — SUMMARY FOR CARBON COMPLIANCE

Released: September 17, 2022 | Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India

OVERVIEW
The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 is India's first integrated logistics policy framework
designed to reduce the logistics cost from the current 13–14% of GDP to single digits (below 8%)
by 2030 and position India among the top-25 countries in the Logistics Performance Index (LPI).
India currently ranks 44th on the Logistics Performance Index (World Bank, 2023).

KEY TARGETS AND TIMELINES
- Logistics cost reduction: From ~14% of GDP to under 8% by 2030.
- Carbon emission reduction: Logistics sector must align with India's Nationally Determined
  Contributions (NDC) — a 45% reduction in emissions intensity of GDP by 2030 vs. 2005 baseline.
- EV fleet mandate: By 2030, at least 30% of last-mile delivery vehicles must be electric
  (FAME II scheme extension under MoHI&PE guidelines).
- Modal shift target: Increase rail freight share from current 27% to 45% by 2030 to reduce
  road transport emissions (road carries 60% of freight by value but emits 88% of transport CO₂).
- Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs): Eastern and Western DFCs now fully operational.
  Expected to shift 350 million tonnes of cargo off roads annually, reducing road CO₂ by
  an estimated 457 million kg/year.

PM-GATSISHAKTI NATIONAL MASTERPLAN
The NLP is implemented through PM-GatiShakti, a digital infrastructure platform integrating
16 Ministries. It provides real-time visibility into 1,600+ infrastructure projects and enables
multimodal freight route optimization. GreenPulse aligns directly with PM-GatiShakti by providing
the real-time carbon intelligence layer that GatiShakti currently lacks.

CARBON BUDGET FRAMEWORK FOR ROAD LOGISTICS
The NLP implicitly sets the following operational CO₂ benchmarks for heavy freight (MoRTH):
- Delhi–Mumbai corridor: Baseline at 850 kg CO₂/trip per 40-tonne truck (diesel, laden).
  Target: 680 kg CO₂/trip by 2027 (20% reduction via route optimization and load efficiency).
- Chennai–Bangalore corridor: Baseline at 210 kg CO₂/trip. Target: 168 kg CO₂/trip.
- Kolkata–Patna corridor: Baseline at 190 kg CO₂/trip. Target: 152 kg CO₂/trip.

COMPLIANCE PENALTIES
The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) under the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme
covers logistics entities with energy consumption above 2,000 TOE (tonnes of oil equivalent)
per year. Non-compliance with PAT cycle targets attracts penalties of ₹10,000 per day.
Under draft rules for Transport Sector Energy Conservation (2024), fleet operators with >100
vehicles are required to maintain a Carbon Intensity Register and submit quarterly CO₂ reports.

FUEL EFFICIENCY NORMS (AIS:147 BS VI)
All new heavy commercial vehicles from April 2023 must comply with fuel consumption norms:
- 16-tonne GVW: Max 25.3 L/100 km laden.
- 40-tonne GVW: Max 35.4 L/100 km laden.
Non-compliant vehicles face type approval rejection and cannot be registered.

RELEVANCE TO GREENPULSE
GreenPulse directly operationalises NLP 2022 targets by computing real-time CO₂ per corridor,
alerting when a vehicle exceeds the per-trip budget, and projecting annualised savings to
demonstrate NLP compliance trajectory. The dashboard's CO₂ Saved counter reflects progress
toward the 20% route-level reduction targets embedded in the NLP.
